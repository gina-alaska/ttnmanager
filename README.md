## Tundra Travel Manager

This was an application developed to support the tundra travel network (TTN) managers.  The goal was to create a public website that showed the 4 zone status and notes from TTN managers about each zone in an easy to understand, low bandwidth friendly, website.

The managers were provided a low bandwidth optimized, offline capable, mobile interface to update zone information while in the field that would then syncronize back to the public website when they had network again.

This website successfully supported the TTN managers for over 5 years before the Alaska DNR IT crew was able to develop an internal replacement to support the Tundra Travel Network.
